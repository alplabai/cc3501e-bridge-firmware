 * cc3501e-bridge firmware: transport seam declarations.
 *
 * The host-control link between the Alif and the CC3501E is
 * CUSTOMER-SELECTABLE:
 *
 *   - SPI0 slave (the CC3501E's SPI0; the Alif master is SPI1)  -- the
 *     DEFAULT and always-available baseline.  Low
 *     pin count, never conflicts with anything else on the SoM.
 *   - SDIO slave  -- OPTIONAL, higher throughput for Wi-Fi data.  The
 *     Alif Ensemble has a SINGLE SDIO controller, shared at board
 *     level (via mux resistors) with the micro-SD slot, so SDIO is
 *     available to the CC3501E only on boards that do NOT populate an
 *     SD card.  When an SD card is used, SDIO is blocked and the link
 *     falls back to SPI.  See docs/cc3501e-bridge.md "Inter-chip
 *     wiring" + "Selectable host-control transport".
 *
 * Exactly one control transport is active per build/boot
 * (CC3501E_CONTROL_TRANSPORT, default spi).  Whichever is active, it
 * feeds the SAME protocol_dispatch() -- one framing format, one
 * command set, one set of reply codes; only the byte-level transport
 * differs (the gd32-bridge SPI + I2C model).
 *
 * The transport sources (transport_spi.c / transport_sdio.c) are
 * SILICON-FREE: framing, staging and the protocol_dispatch() hand-off
 * only.  The byte-level peripheral wiring (TI SimpleLink / driverlib
 * slave init + ISRs) lives in the ti backend under hal/ti/ and drives
 * the seams below.  The stub backend leaves the weak bring-up hooks as
 * no-ops so a host unit test can feed the same seams directly.
