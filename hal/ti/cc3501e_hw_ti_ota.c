 * cc3501e-bridge HAL: TI backend -- OTA firmware update (over-the-bridge
 * PSA-FWU streaming, v0.2).
 *
 * Split by hardware subsystem out of cc3501e_hw_ti.c (issue #703, #461
 * Phase B).  This is the host-driven streaming OTA session (BEGIN / WRITE /
 * FINISH / ABORT / PROMOTE / STATUS); the ONE-SHOT boot-time TRIAL-image
 * accept + the SELFTEST embedded-candidate installer stay in
 * cc3501e_hw_ti.c (they run from cc3501e_hw_tick(), not from a host
 * session).  cc3501e_hw_ti.c also owns the deferred-reboot latch
 * (reply_drained / ota_reboot_pending / ota_reboot_rc) this file arms --
 * see cc3501e_hw_ti_internal.h for the cross-TU seam.
 *
 * Built ONLY for CC3501E_HAL_BACKEND=ti (the bench build), against TI's
 * SimpleLink CC35xx SDK.  CI builds the stub backend instead, so this file
 * is never on the SDK-free path.

/* WINDOW-STAGED OTA (silicon-critical, hardware-SS0/READY bridge).  The psa_fwu_*
 * flash ops share the CC35 HIF/DMA with the bridge SPI slave, so EVERY flash op
 * tears the bridge DMA down, like a radio op.
 *
 * v0.2 answered that by never flashing during WRITE: chunks were memcpy'd into a
 * 64 KiB whole-image buffer and ALL the flash happened once at FINISH.  That made
 * OTA reliable and also capped it at 64 KiB -- ~16x below the 1,089,100 B image
 * the channel exists to deliver (#1610).  The two were the same decision, which
 * is why raising the constant alone could never work.
 *
 * Now: WRITE still never flashes (ISR-safe memcpy, no DMA disruption), but into a
 * SLIDING WINDOW.  When the window fills, WRITE queues OTA_OP_FLUSH and returns
 * BUSY *without consuming the chunk*; the pump commits the window on the bring-up
 * task using the exact burst shape FINISH has always used and that is
 * silicon-proven at 31,428 B and 37,016 B.  FINISH flushes the tail, then
 * finalize + install as before.
 *
 * WHAT THE 2026-06-19 PER-256 B ATTEMPT ACTUALLY GOT WRONG: not the flush size.
 * psa_fwu_write is a direct XMEMWFF3_write with the SDK's SECTOR_SIZE == 4096, so
 * the flash-op count is image_bytes/4096 no matter how the flushes are grouped.
 * The difference is what the host clocks across the blackout -- that attempt kept
 * re-sending payload-bearing WRITE frames into a torn-down slave.  So the host
 * MUST send each WRITE once and then poll header-only until
 * OTA_STATUS.reserved[1] (flush_pending) clears.  The host-side change is
 * mandatory, not an optimisation; see chips/cc3501e/cc3501e_ota.c. */
/* Largest image BEGIN will accept.  This used to be the RAM staging buffer's size
 * (64 KiB), which capped OTA ~16x below the 1,089,100 B image the channel exists
 * to deliver (#1610).  Staging whole was never merely unwise -- it is impossible:
 * DRAM_NON_SECURE is 0x7f24f with ~3 KiB free and ALL RAM on the part sums to
 * 753,659 B.  With windowed staging the RAM bound is gone, so this is now only a
 * SANITY bound; the real ceiling is the vendor slot, enforced by psa_fwu_write
 * failing mid-stream (a clean ERROR, not a silent truncation).  Deliberately NOT
 * derived from a SysConfig slot constant: that value is generated and git-ignored,
 * and a silently-wrong hardcode would reproduce this exact bug one flash-layout
 * change later. */

 * SIZING IS A TUNING KNOB, NOT THE FIX.  psa_fwu_write does no internal
 * buffering -- it is a direct XMEMWFF3_write, one flash op per call (SDK
 * psa_fwu.c:924) -- and the SDK's SECTOR_SIZE is 4096, the same as
 * CC3501E_OTA_FINISH_FLASH_BLOCK.  So the flash-op count is image_bytes/4096
 * (~266 for a 1.09 MB image) WHATEVER window we choose; the window only decides
 * how those ops are grouped into host hold-off episodes (16 KiB -> ~67 episodes
 * of 4 writes).  Bigger = fewer, longer stalls and more .bss; smaller = more,
 * shorter stalls.  What actually decides whether this survives is that the host
 * clocks nothing but header-only polls across each episode (see the host note in
 * ota_flush), which is the one thing the 2026-06-19 per-256 B attempt got wrong.

 * 16 KiB also hands ~48 KiB of .bss back versus the old 64 KiB whole-image

 * -- deliberately, because a frame boundary is the only point at which the SPI
 * FIFOs can be reset without eating a half-consumed phase, and that reset
 * (spi_fifo_reset, hal/ti/transport_hw_ti_spi.c) is what makes this blackout
