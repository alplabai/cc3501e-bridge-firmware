 * cc3501e-bridge HAL: TI backend -- cross-TU seam for the cc3501e_hw_ti_*.c
 * hardware-subsystem split (issue #703, #461 Phase B).
 *
 * The pre-split cc3501e_hw_ti.c kept a handful of items file-static; two of
 * them are now genuinely shared between the split translation units:
 *
 *   - reply_drained / ota_reboot_pending / ota_reboot_rc: the deferred-
 *     reboot latch.  Owned + defined by cc3501e_hw_ti.c (the platform/
 *     lifecycle TU -- cc3501e_hw_tick() sequences the actual reboot), but
 *     armed from cc3501e_hw_ti_ota.c's FINISH/PROMOTE bodies.
 *   - cc3501e_hw_ota_pump(): defined in cc3501e_hw_ti_ota.c, called from
 *     cc3501e_hw_tick() (cc3501e_hw_ti.c) on every idle wakeup.
 *   - cc3501e_hw_wifi_lazy_start(): defined in cc3501e_hw_ti_wifi.c, called
 *     from cc3501e_hw_ti_ble.c's BLE_ENABLE body (BLE shares the HIF with
 *     Wi-Fi, so Wlan_Start must run first -- WIFI_BLE_INTEGRATION.md).
 *
 * NOT a public HAL surface -- only the ti backend's own .c files include
 * this.  The public cc3501e_hw_* contract is unchanged and stays in
 * ../cc3501e_hw.h.
