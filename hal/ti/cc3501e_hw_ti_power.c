/* ---- Radio power save -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The Power_setPolicy() work below only governs the WFF3 CORE.  On a Wi-Fi part
 * the dominant term is the RADIO: an associated station that never enters power
 * save keeps its receiver up continuously, which costs orders of magnitude more
 * than anything the core's WFI/SLEEP state can save.  Nothing in this firmware
 * ever called Wlan_Set(), so every policy -- including DEEP_SLEEP -- left the
 * radio fully awake and the presets differed only in core state.
 *
 * Three independent knobs, all via Wlan_Set (see wlan_if.h):
 *   WLAN_SET_POWER_SAVE       station PS mode (ACTIVE / AUTO / POWER_SAVE)
 *   WLAN_SET_POWER_MANAGEMENT sleep authorisation (ALWAYS_ACTIVE / ELP)
 *   WLAN_SET_LSI              long sleep interval -- wake every Nth DTIM
 *
 * LSI is what finally separates LOW_POWER from DEEP_SLEEP.  Before this the two
 * presets were documented as sharing one reachable state because WFF3 exposes a
 * single core SLEEP tier; on the radio side they are genuinely different.
 *
 * LATENCY IS THE TRADE.  Waking only every Nth DTIM means inbound frames queue
 * at the AP until the next wake, so DEEP_SLEEP adds hundreds of ms of inbound
 * latency and will cut throughput hard.  That is the point of the preset, and it
 * is why BALANCED -- not a low-power mode -- stays the default. */

 * executing the very policy being replaced.
 *
 * That race is issue #1683.  With BLE enabled, applying a preset intermittently
 * wedged the whole device -- the policy call timed out and the bridge went to
 * PING -> -5, unrecoverable without a reset, at a point that moved between runs.
 * It is NOT the radio half: the wedge survived skipping every Wlan_Set() call.
 * BLE does not cause it either, it just loads the shared HIF enough to lose the
 * race reliably -- which is why a Wi-Fi-only build looked fine for so long.
